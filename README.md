# Insurance Claim Fraud Detection
#### Problem Statement :
- The aim of this project is to build a model that can detect auto insurance fraud.
- The main challenge behind this is that fraud is far less common as compared to legit insurance claims.
- This is classification problem
- This type of problems is known as imbalanced class classification
- frauds are unethical & are losses to the company 
- By building a model that can classify auto insurance fraud I am able to cut the losses for the insurance company 
- less losses equates to more earning.

#### Objective :
- The objective of this project is to predict the fraud on the basis of the data provided by using machine learning models.

#### Data Collection :
- The data was collected is from one of the genuine website __UC Irvine mchine learning repository__.
